# drift-persistence
Initial code for a drift detector that considers filtrations and persistence. Results are reported in a KDD'2024 workshop paper.

The source code is under revision, becuase Ripser package has issues to be run in a notebook, but it works fine in Python. Therefore, I am cleaning the current code to have only a source code in Python.
